Orbs Contributors Guide

We welcome and thank you in advance for considering contributing to the development of the Orbs project. 

This guide is for those developers who are interested in contributing to the project in a technical, hands-on manner by submitting code, bug reports or pull requests to the project Github.

If you are interested in other ways to contribute, feel free to check out participation in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake or join the discussions in one of our channels like Telegram or Discord.  

This Contributors Guide is for general contributions to all Orbs repositories (over 160 developed so far). It is possible that additional processes and procedures may apply to specific repositories. For the full list of repositories, see https://github.com/orgs/orbs-network/repositories.  

All Orbs source code is subject to the MIT license. 

Feel free to tackle any open issues or suggest a new direction. 

Discussion 
If you see something you are interested in working on or have a suggestion you would like to add, please check our open issues first to see if there is anything relevant.  

It is also a good idea to first communicate with other developers in the discord chat. This way you can get some early feedback and also avoid duplicating efforts or wasting time on ideas that have already been rejected based on previous work.

You can also initiate a discussion by opening an issue in the relevant place.   

Submissions

To make a bug report, please open an issue and provide a detailed report so that it can be dealt with as quickly as possible.

To submit a feature request, please file a Github using the issues menu item. 

To contribute code, please commit and send a pull request. The core developers will review and communicate with you using the comments section. After the submission is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main code base and deployed to the live implementation of the Orbs Network node software on the next available date.  

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not post an issue or on discord.  Instead, we would appreciate it if you reported it privately at: [hello@orbs.com]. This allows us to distribute a fix before the vulnerability is exploited.

Testing Strategy
Testing is a crucial part of our development process. Please write tests for your code. 

Contributions without full test coverage will not be accepted. We use Test-Driven Development to help shape and evolve our design, and would prefer any contributed code to have been developed using TDD.
